# Linux Server Hardening Checklist with Tools and Policies
#####################################

### System Updates and Advanced Patch Management
- [ ] Automate system updates: Use tools like `unattended-upgrades` or `yum-cron`.
- [ ] Monitor security bulletins: Use RSS feeds or mailing lists.
Policy: Schedule regular updates (e.g., weekly), immediate action on critical patches.

### Advanced User Account Management
- [ ] Enforce password complexity: Utilize PAM with `pam_pwquality` module.
- [ ] Implement two-factor authentication: Use tools like Google Authenticator or Duo.
- [ ] Audit user accounts: Regularly run `getent passwd` and review accounts.
Policy: Define password policies (length, complexity), regular account review schedule.

### SSH Hardening
- [ ] Use SSH Protocol 2: Set `Protocol 2` in `sshd_config`.
- [ ] Restrict SSH access: Use `AllowUsers`/`AllowGroups` in `sshd_config`.
- [ ] Implement rate limiting: Use `Fail2Ban` or `iptables` for SSH brute force protection.
Policy: Document approved users/groups, enable Fail2Ban with specific thresholds.

### Advanced Firewall Configuration
- [ ] Stateful packet inspection: Use `ufw` or `firewalld`.
- [ ] Tighten firewall rules: Regularly audit and update rules.
- [ ] Port knocking/SPA: Implement using `fwknop` or similar.
Policy: Define minimal necessary ports/services, review firewall rules quarterly.

### Intrusion Detection and Prevention
- [ ] Set up IDS/IPS: Use `Snort`, `Suricata`, or `Fail2Ban`.
- [ ] Real-time alerting: Integrate IDS with monitoring tools like `Nagios` or `Zabbix`.
Policy: Regular IDS signature updates, immediate investigation of alerts.

### Enhanced System Auditing and Logging
- [ ] Remote logging: Use `rsyslog` or `syslog-ng` to a secure server.
- [ ] Log file integrity: Implement `logwatch` or `Swatch`.
- [ ] Audit logs: Regularly review logs, use `auditd` for system event monitoring.
Policy: Retain logs for a defined period, regular log review schedule.

### Network Security Enhancements
- [ ] Network stack hardening: Apply sysctl settings (e.g., `net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies`).
- [ ] Network segmentation: Use VLANs or firewall rules.
- [ ] Update network devices: Regularly check for firmware updates.
Policy: Define network zones, restrict inter-zone traffic.

### Advanced Access Controls
- [ ] Implement RBAC: Use tools like `sudo` with detailed `sudoers` file.
- [ ] Audit SUID/SGID binaries: Regularly run `find / -perm -4000` and similar commands.
- [ ] Granular `sudoers`: Use `visudo` for precise control.
Policy: Document roles and associated permissions, regular audit of SUID/SGID files.

### Filesystem and Data Integrity
- [ ] Full disk encryption: Use `LUKS` or `dm-crypt`.
- [ ] File integrity checks: Implement `AIDE` or `Tripwire`.
- [ ] Ensure file ownership: Regularly check for unowned files.
Policy: Regular file integrity scans, strict control over file permissions.

### Kernel Security and Hardening
- [ ] Kernel updates: Regularly update to the latest stable version.
- [ ] Security modules: Configure SELinux, AppArmor, or grsecurity.
- [ ] Sysctl hardening: Apply settings like `kernel.randomize_va_space`.
Policy: Regular kernel updates, mandatory use of security modules.

### Advanced Application Security
- [ ] Application whitelisting: Use `AppArmor` or `SELinux` policies.
- [ ] Application configuration review: Regular audits, use tools like `lynis` for scanning.
- [ ] Service isolation: Use Docker or other containerization tools.
Policy: Defined list of approved applications, regular review of application configurations.

### Encryption and Secure Data Handling
- [ ] Encrypt data: Use `GnuPG` for file encryption, `OpenSSL` for TLS.
- [ ] Enforce TLS: Configure web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to use SSL/TLS.
- [ ] Key management: Regularly rotate keys and certificates using tools like `certbot`.
Policy: Encrypt all sensitive data, mandatory HTTPS for all web services.

### Security Monitoring and Advanced Auditing
- [ ] SIEM systems: Implement tools like `Splunk` or `ELK Stack`.
- [ ] Penetration testing: Use `Metasploit`, `nmap`, or hire external services.
- [ ] Anomaly detection: Utilize machine learning-based tools or services.
Policy: Regular penetration tests, continuous monitoring with SIEM.

# ### Compliance and Advanced Vulnerability Assessment
# - [ ] Audit against benchmarks: Use `OpenSCAP` for CIS compliance.
# - [ ] Vulnerability scanning: Implement `Nessus` or `OpenVAS`.
# - [ ] Risk assessments: Conduct using frameworks like NIST or ISO standards.
# Policy: Regular compliance audits, prompt action on identified vulnerabilities.

# ### Security Training and Organizational Security Policy
# - [ ] Security policy: Develop comprehensive policies, use tools like `DocuSign` for acknowledgment.
# - [ ] Advanced training: Conduct with tools like `GoPhish` for phishing simulations.
# - [ ] Policy review: Regular updates, use policy management software.
# Policy: Mandatory security training, regular policy reviews and updates.

# ### Comprehensive Incident Response and Forensics
# - [ ] Incident response plan: Document and regularly update.
# - [ ] Forensic training: Use tools like `Sleuth Kit` or external training services.
# - [ ] Incident drills: Conduct simulations, use tools like `RedSeal` for network simulation.
# Policy: Detailed incident response procedures, regular forensic analysis training.

### Advanced Backup and Disaster Recovery
- [ ] Automated backups: Use `rsync`, `Bacula`, or cloud-based solutions.
- [ ] Backup testing: Regularly test recovery procedures.
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan: Document and maintain with tools like `BCP Toolkit`.
Policy: Regular backup schedule, annual disaster recovery drills.
